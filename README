xnat - SNAT(Source network address translation) base host name(DNS).

Purpors:

  Sometimes we like to use different "lines"(or tunnel?) to read different web pages, for security or anonymous, or something else(may be the website was blocked by ISP).

  For example, I have one cheap DSL line, one expensive VPN line, and I want to read "www.dsl.com" on DSL line, "www.vpn.com" on VPN line. So, what should I do?

  There may be 2 ways to make it done:(tell me if I'm wrong)
  
  1). Shutdown VPN until you want to read "www.vpn.com", that means you can't use DSL and VPN at the same time.
  2). Add some route rule, so that you can read "www.dsl.com" and "www.vpn.com" at the same time.

  The main disadvantage of method(2) is that: you have to resolve the IP address of host name before cooking any route rule. Unfortunately, the IP address of host name usually not fixed.

  With xnat, all you need is:

  1). Config "www.dsl.com" use source address "6.6.6.6", and "www.vpn.com" use "9.9.9.9".
  2). Route packet from "6.6.6.6" go to DSL, go to VPN when from "9.9.9.9".

  then everything goes well.
